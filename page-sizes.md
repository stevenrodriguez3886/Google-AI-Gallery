16 KB Google Play compatibility requirement Starting November 1st, 2025, all new apps and updates to existing apps submitted to Google Play and targeting Android 15+ devices must support 16 KB page sizes on 64-bit devices. [Read More →](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/prepare-play-apps-for-devices-with-16kb-page-size.html) ![](https://developer.android.com/static/distribute/images/heroes/google-play-hero.svg)

Historically, Android has only supported 4 KB memory page sizes, which has
optimized system memory performance for the average amount of total memory that
Android devices have typically had. Beginning with Android 15, AOSP supports
devices that are configured to use a page size of 16 KB (16 KB
devices). If your app uses any [NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk) libraries, either directly
or indirectly through an SDK, then you will need to rebuild your app for it to
work on these 16 KB devices.

As device manufacturers continue to build devices with larger amounts of
physical memory (RAM), many of these devices will adopt 16 KB (and
eventually greater) page sizes to optimize the device's performance. Adding
support for 16 KB page size devices enables your app to run on these
devices and helps your app benefit from the associated performance
improvements. Without recompiling, apps won't work on 16 KB devices in
future Android releases.

To help you add support for your app, we've provided guidance on how to [check
if your app is impacted](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#16-kb-impact), how to
[rebuild your app](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#build) (if applicable), and how to [test your app in
a 16 KB environment](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#test) using emulators (including Android 15
system images for the Android Emulator).

## Benefits and performance gains

Devices configured with 16 KB page sizes use slightly more memory on
average, but also gain various performance improvements for both the system and
apps:

- Lower app launch times while the system is under memory pressure: 3.16% lower on average, with more significant improvements (up to 30%) for some apps that we tested
- Reduced power draw during app launch: 4.56% reduction on average
- Faster camera launch: 4.48% faster hot starts on average, and 6.60% faster cold starts on average
- Improved system boot time: improved by 8% (approximately 950 milliseconds) on average

These improvements are based on our initial testing, and results on actual
devices will likely differ. We'll provide additional analysis of potential gains
for apps as we continue our testing.

## Check if your app is impacted

If your app [uses any native code](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#native-code), then you should [rebuild
your app with support for 16 KB devices](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#build). If you are unsure
if your app uses native code, you can [use the APK Analyzer to identify whether
any native code is present](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#identify-native-code) and then [check the alignment of ELF
segments for any shared libraries](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#elf-alignment) that you find. Android Studio
also provides features that help you to [automatically detect alignment
issues](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#auto-checks).

If your app only uses code written in the Java programming language or in
Kotlin, including all libraries or SDKs, then your app already supports
16 KB devices. Nevertheless, we recommend that you [test your app in a
16 KB environment](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#test) to verify that there are no unexpected
regressions in app behavior.

### Does your app use native code?

Your app makes use of native code if any of the following apply:

- Your app uses any C/C++ (native) code. If your app uses the [Android
  NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk), then your app uses native code.
- Your app links with any third-party native libraries or dependencies (such as SDKs) that use them.
- Your app is built by a third-party app builder that uses native libraries on device.

### Identify native libraries using APK Analyzer

[APK Analyzer](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/apk-analyzer) is a tool that lets you evaluate various aspects of a built
APK. To check whether your app uses native code (regardless of whether it is
16 KB compatible):

1. Open *Android Studio* , then click **File \> Open** and choose any project.
2. From the menu bar, click **Build \> Analyze APK...**

   ![Studio Build menu option to launch APK Analyzer](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/practices/studio-analyze-apk-option.png)
3. Choose the APK you want to analyze.

4. Look within the `lib` folder, which hosts shared object (`.so`) files if any
   are present. If any shared object files are present, your app uses native
   code. The *Alignment* column displays warning messages for any files that
   have alignment issues. If no shared object files are present or there is no
   `lib` folder, then your app doesn't use native code.

   ![APK Analyzer view showing that shared object files are present](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/practices/apk-analyzer-so-files.png)

### Detect alignment issues with automated checks

Android Studio warns you proactively if your prebuilt libraries or APKs aren't
16 KB compliant. Use the [APK
Analyzer](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#identify-native-code) tool to review which libraries need to be
updated or if any code changes are required.
![Studio warning notifications about alignment issues in a project](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/practices/studio-align-warnings.png)

[Lint in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint) also highlights native libraries that
aren't 16 KB aligned.
![Studio linter warning about a non-aligned native library](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/practices/studio-align-lint.png)

### Check the alignment of ELF segments for shared libraries

For any shared libraries, verify that the shared libraries' ELF segments are
aligned properly using 16 KB ELF alignment. If you are developing on either
Linux or macOS, you can use the `check_elf_alignment.sh` script as described in
the following section. You can also [use the command-line tools directly](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#alignment-use-tools).

#### Use the check_elf_alignment.sh script (Linux or macOS)

Follow these steps to check the alignment of ELF segments using the
`check_elf_alignment.sh` script:

1. Save the [`check_elf_alignment.sh`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:system/extras/tools/check_elf_alignment.sh) script to a file.

2. Run the script on your app's APK file:

       check_elf_alignment.sh APK_NAME.apk

   The script outputs either `ALIGNED` or `UNALIGNED` for all the `arm64-v8a`
   shared libraries.
3. If any `arm64-v8a` or `x86_64` shared libraries are `UNALIGNED`, you'll need
   to [update the packaging for those libraries](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#update-packaging), then [recompile your
   app](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#compile-16-kb-alignment) and retest by following the steps in this section.

#### Use command-line tools directly

Follow these steps to check the alignment of ELF segments using command-line
tools directly:

1. Make sure both Android SDK Build-Tools version 35.0.0 or higher and the Android NDK are installed using the [SDK Manager in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update#sdk-manager) or [`sdkmanager`](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdkmanager) command-line tool.
2. Extract your app's APK file:

   ### Linux or macOS

       unzip APK_NAME.apk -d /tmp/my_apk_out

   ### Windows (PowerShell)

       Expand-Archive -Path .\APK_NAME.apk -DestinationPath ~\tmp\my_apk_out

3. In the temporary directory that you extracted your APK file to, check the
   contents of the `lib` directory for shared object (`.so`) files. These are
   the same shared object files that you would've seen while [identifying
   native libraries using APK Analyzer](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#identify-native-code). Run the following command on each
   shared object file:

   ### Linux or macOS

       SDK_ROOT_LOCATION/Android/sdk/ndk/NDK_VERSION/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/llvm-objdump -p SHARED_OBJECT_FILE.so | grep LOAD

   ### Windows (PowerShell)

       SDK_ROOT_LOCATION\Android\sdk\ndk\NDK_VERSION\toolchains\llvm\prebuilt\windows-x86_64\bin\llvm-objdump.exe -p SHARED_OBJECT_FILE.so | Select-String -Pattern "LOAD"

   Where <var translate="no">`SDK_ROOT_LOCATION`</var> is the path to the
   directory where you've installed the Android SDK,
   <var translate="no">`SHARED_OBJECT_FILE`</var> is the name of the shared object
   file that you're checking, and <var translate="no">`NDK_VERSION`</var> is the
   version of the Android NDK that you have installed (for example,
   `28.0.12433566`). The output will look something like the following for each
   file you check:

       LOAD off    0x0000000000000000 vaddr 0x0000000000000000 paddr 0x0000000000000000 align 2**14
       LOAD off    0x0000000000042a90 vaddr 0x0000000000043a90 paddr 0x0000000000043a90 align 2**14
       LOAD off    0x0000000000046230 vaddr 0x0000000000048230 paddr 0x0000000000048230 align 2**14

4. Check the output lines to ensure that the load segments don't have values
   less than `2**14`. If any load segments are `2**13`, `2**12`, or lower
   values, you'll need to [update the packaging for those libraries](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#update-packaging), then
   [recompile your app](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#compile-16-kb-alignment) and retest by following the steps in this section.

5. Next, run the `zipalign` command-line tool on your app's APK file:

   ### Linux or macOS

       SDK_ROOT_LOCATION/Android/sdk/build-tools/35.0.0/zipalign -v -c -P 16 4 APK_NAME.apk

   ### Windows (PowerShell)

       SDK_ROOT_LOCATION\Android\sdk\build-tools\35.0.0\zipalign.exe -v -c -P 16 4 APK_NAME.apk

   Where <var translate="no">`SDK_ROOT_LOCATION`</var> is the path to the
   directory where you've installed the Android SDK, and
   <var translate="no">`APK_NAME`</var> is the name of your app's APK file. The
   last line of the output will say "Verification successful" if all of the
   shared libraries are aligned correctly.

   If the verification failed, some shared libraries need to be realigned, so
   you'll need to [update the packaging for those libraries](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#update-packaging), then
   [recompile your app](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#compile-16-kb-alignment) and retest by following the steps in this section.

## Build your app with support for 16 KB devices

If your app uses native code, then complete the steps that are outlined in the
following sections to make sure that your app supports 16 KB devices:

1. [Update the packaging of your shared libraries](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#update-packaging)
2. [Compile your app using 16 KB ELF alignment](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#compile-16-kb-alignment)
3. [Fix code and resolve runtime issues](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#check-code)
4. [Check SDKs for 16 KB support](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#check-sdks)

> [!TIP]
> **Tip:** If you update your tools to the latest versions (AGP version 8.5.1 or higher and NDK version r28 or higher) and use 16 KB-compatible prebuilt dependencies, then your app is 16 KB compatible by default and you can skip to the step for [fixing code and resolving runtime issues](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#check-code).

### Update the packaging of your shared libraries

Upgrade to AGP version 8.5.1 or higher and use uncompressed shared libraries.

#### Use `bundletool` to verify zip alignment

To see the alignment of your bundle, use:

    bundletool dump config --bundle=<my .aab>  | grep alignment

If you see `PAGE_ALIGNMENT_16K` then you know your bundle requests 16 KB
zip alignment. If you see `PAGE_ALIGNMENT_4K`, this instructs the APK built from
this AAB to have 4 KB aligned .so files in the zip file.

#### AGP version 8.5.1 or higher

16 KB devices require apps that ship with uncompressed shared libraries to
align them on a 16 KB zip-aligned boundary. To do this, you need to upgrade
to Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version 8.5.1 or higher. Refer to the [Android
Gradle plugin Upgrade Assistant](https://developer.android.com/build/agp-upgrade-assistant) section for details on the upgrade process.

#### AGP version 8.5 or lower

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** In AGP version 8.3 to 8.5, apps are 16 KB aligned by default. However, `bundletool` does not zipalign APKs by default. So, the app may appear to work, but when built from a bundle in Play, it won't install.

If you can't upgrade AGP to version 8.5.1 or higher, then the alternative is to
switch to use compressed shared libraries. Update your Gradle configuration to
have Gradle compress your shared libraries when packaging your app to avoid app
installation issues with unaligned shared libraries.

### Groovy

In your `build.gradle` file, add the following option:

    android {
      ...
      packagingOptions {
          jniLibs {
            useLegacyPackaging true
          }
      }
    }

### Kotlin

In your `build.gradle.kts` file, add the following option:

    android {
      ...
      packagingOptions {
          jniLibs {
            useLegacyPackaging = true
          }
      }
    }

##### AGP version 8.0 or lower

If you are using an AGP version same or lower than 8.0, you also need to disable
the uncompressed native library option for App Bundles in your
`gradle.properties` file:

    android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs=false

> [!WARNING]
> **Warning:** When you use compressed shared libraries, your app takes up more space when installed, as libraries are extracted from the APK and copied onto disk. Your app might more frequently fail to install because this increase in disk usage means there is less space on device. To avoid this, upgrade to AGP version 8.5.1 or higher.

### Compile your app using 16 KB ELF alignment

16 KB devices require the shared libraries' ELF segments to be aligned
properly using 16 KB ELF alignment in order for your app to run.

For game developers, if your game runs on top of [Unity game engine](https://unity.com), refer
to the [Unity guide](https://developer.android.com/games/engines/unity/unity-on-android#16-kb-page-support). If your game runs on top of [Unreal game engine](https://www.unrealengine.com),
refer to the [Unreal guide](https://developer.android.com/games/engines/unreal/unreal-on-android#16-kb-page-support). For native game engines, continue with
this guide.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** If your app doesn't extract native libraries to the file system ([`extractNativeLibs`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#extractNativeLibs) set to `false`), you'll likely notice a slight increase in your app's binary size after compiling using a 16 KB ELF alignment. Optimizations to the package manager in Android 15 negate the runtime costs from this increase.

To compile your app using 16 KB ELF alignment, complete the steps in one of
the following sections depending on the version of the Android NDK that you're
using.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important:** If your app uses any [prebuilt shared libraries](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/prebuilts), you must also recompile them in the same way and reimport the 16 KB-aligned libraries into your app.

#### Android NDK r28 and higher

NDK version r28 and higher compile 16 KB-aligned by default.

#### Android NDK r27 and lower


To support compiling 16 KB-aligned shared libraries with Android NDK
version r27 or lower, use the following linker flags:

    -Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384
    -Wl,-z,common-page-size=16384

Here's how to update your build system configuration files:

### ndk-build

If you're using ndk-build, update your `Android.mk` to enable 16 KB ELF
alignment:

    LOCAL_LDFLAGS += -Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384 -Wl,-z,common-page-size=16384

### CMake

If you're using CMake, update your `CMakeLists.txt` to enable 16 KB ELF
alignment:

    target_link_options(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE
        "-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384"
        "-Wl,-z,common-page-size=16384"
    )

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Even if your app dynamically links to the C++ standard library (`libc++_shared.so`) from NDKs r26 and lower, some of which don't have a 16 KB aligned `libc++_shared.so`, you should still update the alignment of all other libraries here, and you should update your code to avoid depending on `PAGE_SIZE`. In order to test on those lower versions of the NDK on 16 KB devices, canary releases of LTS NDK versions [r23](https://ci.android.com/builds/branches/aosp-ndk-release-r23/grid) and [r25](https://ci.android.com/builds/branches/aosp-ndk-r25-release/grid) are available on Android CI with 16 KB aligned `libc++_shared.so` libraries.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** If you can't move to the newer Android NDK, then you might be able to update your app to statically compile the C++ standard library into your shared library. Refer to the [C++ Library Support](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpp-support) section for details on statically linking to the C++ standard library and be sure to read the [Important Considerations](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpp-support#ic) section.

### Fix code and resolve runtime issues

Even if your app is 16 KB-aligned, your app can encounter errors if places
in your code assume that a device is using a specific page size. To avoid this,
complete the following steps:

1. Remove any hard-coded dependencies that reference the [`PAGE_SIZE`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:bionic/libc/include/bits/page_size.h;l=34-39)
   constant or instances in your code logic that assume that a device's page
   size is 4 KB (`4096`).

   Use [`getpagesize()`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:bionic/libc/bionic/getpagesize.cpp;l=32) or [`sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:bionic/libc/bionic/sysconf.cpp;l=151) instead.
2. Look for usages of [`mmap()`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:bionic/libc/bionic/mmap.cpp;l=59) and other APIs that require page-aligned
   arguments and replace with alternatives where necessary.

In some cases, if your app uses `PAGE_SIZE` as a convenient value that isn't
tied to the underlying page size, then this won't cause your app to break when
used in 16 KB mode. However, if this value is passed to the kernel with
`mmap` without `MAP_FIXED`, the kernel still uses an entire page, which wastes
some memory. For these reasons, `PAGE_SIZE` is undefined when 16 KB mode is
enabled on NDK r27 and higher.

If your app uses `PAGE_SIZE` in this way and never directly passes this value to
the kernel, then instead of using `PAGE_SIZE`, create a new variable with a new
name to reflect that it is used for other purposes and does not reflect a real
memory page.

### Check SDKs for 16 KB support

Many SDKs are compatible with 16 KB page sizes, especially if you build
them yourself or get recent prebuilts. However, because some SDK prebuilts or
SDK versions aren't 16 KB compatible, you should check the website for each
SDK provider to determine which version to use with 16 KB.

## Test your app in a 16 KB environment

After you build your app with support for 16 KB devices, you'll want to
test your app in a 16 KB environment to see whether your app experiences
any regressions. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Set up the [Android 15 SDK](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/setup-sdk) or higher.

2. Set up one of the following testing environments:

   - [Set up the Android Emulator with a 16 KB--based, Android 15 system
     image](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#16kb-emulator)
     - [Use Cuttlefish with 16 KB page size on ARM64](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/16kb-page-size/getting-started-cf-arm64-pgagnostic)
     - [Simulate Cuttlefish with 16 KB page size on x86-64](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/16kb-page-size/getting-started-cf-x86-64-pgagnostic)
   - [Enable 16 KB mode on a device using developer options](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#developer-option)
   - [Use Samsung Remote Test Lab](https://developer.samsung.com/remote-test-lab/blog/en/2025/07/07/optimize-your-applications-for-16-kb-page-size-compatibility-using-samsungs-remote-test-lab) on 16 KB [supported devices](https://developer.samsung.com/remotetestlab/devices/129/16kb-page-size)
3. Start up your test device, then run the following command to verify that
   it's using a 16 KB environment:

       adb shell getconf PAGE_SIZE

   The command should return a value of `16384`.
4. Run the following [`zipalign`](https://developer.android.com/tools/zipalign) command to verify that your app is
   16 KB-aligned, where <var translate="no">APK_NAME</var> is the name of
   your app's APK file:

       zipalign -c -P 16 -v 4 APK_NAME.apk

5. Thoroughly test your app, focusing on any areas that might be affected by
   [changing code instances that reference specific page sizes](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#check-code).

### Set up the Android Emulator with a 16-KB-based system image

To set up a 16 KB environment using the Android Emulator, follow these
steps:

1. In Android Studio, click **Tools \> SDK Manager**.
2. In the **SDK Platforms** tab, check **Show Package Details** , then expand
   the **Android VanillaIceCream** or higher section and select one or both of
   the following emulator system images, depending on the virtual devices you
   want to create:

   - Google APIs Experimental 16 KB Page Size ARM 64 v8a System Image
   - Google APIs Experimental 16 KB Page Size Intel x86_64 Atom System Image

   > [!NOTE]
   > **Note:** If you're planning to [emulate a supported Google Pixel device](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/get#google-pixel-devices), you will only need the ARM 64 v8a System Image.

   ![Download 16 KB emulator system images using the SDK Manager in
   Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/practices/16kb-emulator-images.png)
3. Click **Apply \> OK** to download whichever system images you selected.

4. Follow the steps to [set up a virtual device for Android 15](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/get#on_emulator), and when
   prompted to select a system image, select the 16 KB system image that
   you downloaded. If it's not recommended automatically, you can find the
   16 KB system image in the **Other Images** tab.

   ![Find the 16 KB emulator image in the Other Images tab](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/practices/16kb-other-images-tab.png)

#### Launch the emulator

After you finish setting up the Android Emulator and virtual devices, launch the
emulator [from the target device menu](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#runningapp), or [from the command line](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline).

### Enable 16 KB mode on a device using developer options

![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/practices/16-kb-dev-option.png)

Toggle the **Boot with 16KB page size** developer
option to boot a device in 16 KB mode.

In QPR versions of Android 15, you can
[use the developer option](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/16kb-page-size/16kb-developer-option#use_16kb_toggle) that's available on certain
devices to boot the device in 16 KB mode and perform on-device testing.
Before using the developer option, go to **Settings \> System \> Software
updates** and apply any updates that are available.

This developer option is available on the following devices:

- Pixel 8 and 8 Pro (with Android 15 QPR1 or higher)

- Pixel 8a (with Android 15 QPR1 or higher)

- Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL (with Android 15 QPR2 or higher)

- Pixel 9a (with Android 16 or higher)

<br />

## 16 KB backcompat mode

![Warning in page size compat mod](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/practices/appcompat-dialog-16kb.png)

Warning in page size compat mode

The 16 KB backcompat option is available when a device is running with a
16 KB kernel. The package manager runs an app in 16 KB backcompat mode
when the following conditions are met:

- If the app has ELF files (with an `.so` extension) with a LOAD segment alignment of 4 KB.
- If the zipped APK has uncompressed ELF files that are 4 KB ZIP aligned.

If the package manager has enabled 16 KB backcompat mode for
an app, the app displays a warning when it's first launched saying that it's
running in 16 KB backcompat mode.

16 KB backcompat mode allows some apps to work,
but for best reliability and stability, apps should still be 16 KB aligned.

On the app info page, under **Advanced** , toggle the setting **Run app with
page size compat mode** to enable or disable the 16 KB backcompat mode
for specific app. This setting is visible only when the device is running with
16 KB page size.

![Page size compat mode setting](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/practices/appcompat-setting-16kb.png)

*Page size compat mode setting*

To force 16 KB backcompat on for every app on the device:

    adb shell setprop bionic.linker.16kb.app_compat.enabled true
    adb shell setprop pm.16kb.app_compat.disabled false

To force 16 KB backcompat off for every app on the device:

    adb shell setprop bionic.linker.16kb.app_compat.enabled false
    adb shell setprop pm.16kb.app_compat.disabled true

In Android 17, you can also force 16 KB backcompat off for every app and
cause any incompatible binary to immediately abort:

        adb shell setprop bionic.linker.16kb.app_compat.enabled fatal
        adb shell setprop pm.16kb.app_compat.disabled true

Set the `android:pageSizeCompat` property to enabled or disabled to turn on or
off backcompat mode for a specific app in its `AndroidManifest.xml`. When this
property is set, the app won't display backcompat mode warnings when it

## Google Play compatibility requirement

As device manufacturers equip devices with more RAM to optimize performance,
many will adopt larger page sizes like 16 KB. To prepare for the launch of
these upcoming devices, Google Play is introducing a new compatibility
requirement: starting November 1st, 2025, all new apps and updates to existing
apps submitted to Google Play and targeting devices running Android 15 (API
level 35) and higher must support 16 KB page sizes.
